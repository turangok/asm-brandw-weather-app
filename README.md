Weather App Project 

you can try it from here: 
https://asm-brandw-weather-app.vercel.app/

This is a small weather forecast application giving info about 5 big cities.  

No fancy UI, because it is done quickly :)

Although it is not necessary for that much small project, REDUX is used as a state management library for demo purposes.
